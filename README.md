# HideIt
A Win32 application that allows the user to change transparency of a window or hide it entirely from both the task bar and desktop.

## Using the program
Upon launch, you will be greeted by a screen telling you how to see the different keybinds.
HideIt mainly uses the "|" key to operate, and uses other modifier keys such as SHIFT, CTRL and ALT to provide functionality.

Pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + I` opens a list of keybinds.

HideIt is also hidden from both the desktop and task bar, and only uses message boxes to "communicate", making it very discreet.

To close the program, use `CTRL + SHIFT + |`.

**NOTE:** The | key is NOT usable while this software is running.

## Use areas
The software may be useful for cases where you need to for example read and type at the same time without access to an additional monitor.
You may then lower the transparency of your text editor to be able to read at the same time.
It was mainly created for me to get a better grasp at the Win32 API.

I do NOT recommend using this software to cheat on tests, exams, etc. as it's still possible to find out you're using the software, by using task manager.
